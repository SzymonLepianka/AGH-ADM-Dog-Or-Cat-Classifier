## Topic of the project
Dogs & Cats image classification

Author: Szymon Lepianka

### Description

The main goal of the project is to build a neural network model that would be able to classify whether a given photo shows a dog or a cat, based on their image. Dataset used comes from kaggle.com:

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaunthesheep/microsoft-catsvsdogs-dataset)

and contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. This can be best utilized in a binary classification problem set in computer vision.
